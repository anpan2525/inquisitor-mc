Inquisitor collects player information and statistics and stores them in a MySQL database. It also provides a built-in web server and templating system to allow viewing stored data over the web.

This plugin is related to, but independent from, the [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/transporter/|Transporter]] plugin. It was born when certain features in that other plugin were deemed "out of scope" and belonged in a separate plugin. That said, Transporter integrates with Inquisitor to provide that plugin's "Realm Support".

===Announcements===
* v2.18 has been released!

===Installation===
Java code (and therefore this plugin) requires a database driver to access a database. If you already use MySQL with your Bukkit server you can probably skip this step. If this is the first time you've configured a Bukkit plugin to use MySQL, read on.

Download the plugin's jar file, drop it into your plugins folder, start Bukkit. At the console, configure the plugin to connect to a previously created MySQL database. See [[Commands]] and [[Configuration]] for details.

===Documentation===

This plugin uses [[http://mcstats.org|Plugin Metrics]] for gathering of anonymous statistics. To opt-out, set "opt-out" to true in your Metrics config file (plugins/PluginMetrics/config.yml).
